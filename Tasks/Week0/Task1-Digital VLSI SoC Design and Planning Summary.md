# Task 1 â€” Digital VLSI SoC Design and Planning

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction
This document provides an overview of the initial concepts in **Digital VLSI SoC Design and Planning**.  
It covers the step-by-step flow starting from chip modeling to SoC integration and highlights how RTL design, synthesis, and verification come together to build a complete System-on-Chip.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Chip Modeling (O1)
- The design process begins with **chip specifications**, usually written in **C model**.  
- The specifications define the **functionality and behavior** of the chip.  
- A **testbench** in C language is used to validate the correctness of the specifications.  
- This step ensures that the design intent is properly captured before moving to RTL implementation.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ RTL Architecture (O2)
- Once specifications are finalized, the hardware is described using **RTL (Register Transfer Level)**, typically in **Verilog**.  
- RTL forms the **soft copy of hardware** which can be synthesized later.  
- At this stage, the design is divided into:  
  - **Processor**  
  - **Peripherals / IPs**  
- RTL is verified to ensure functionality matches the specification.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Synthesis and Netlist Generation
- The RTL code is converted into a **Gate-Level Netlist (GLN)** through synthesis.  
- Outputs include:  
  - **Gate-Level Netlist** (logic equivalent of RTL)  
  - **Synthesized Macros**  
  - **Analog IPs** (functional models in RTL)  

---

## ðŸ”¹ SoC Integration (O3)
- Processor, peripherals, and IP blocks are **integrated at the SoC level**.  
- This stage ensures proper connectivity, bus communication, and GPIO mapping.  
- Floorplanning, placement, CTS (Clock Tree Synthesis), and routing are performed.  
- Hardened macros (hard macros â€“ HM) and analog IP libraries are integrated.  
- The output is a **GDSII file**, which represents the final chip layout.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Physical Verification
- After SoC integration, **DRC (Design Rule Check)** and **LVS (Layout vs Schematic)** checks are performed.  
- These ensure the design is manufacturable and matches the intended functionality.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Final SoC (O4)
- The complete SoC includes processor, peripherals, and IPs operating at **10 MHz â€“ 130 MHz**.  
- The validated design can be applied in multiple real-world applications such as:  
  - iWatch  
  - Arduino boards  
  - TV panels  
  - AC applications

## âœ… Key Takeaways
- **Chip Modeling â†’ RTL Design â†’ Synthesis â†’ SoC Integration â†’ Physical Verification â†’ Final SoC** is the complete flow.  
- Verification at every stage ensures correctness and manufacturability.  
- A single design can be reused for multiple end-applications by integrating different peripherals and IPs.
